                <h3>DAY/NIGHT</h3>
                <p>We rented a house and started writing out in the forest. 2020 had just begun, Australia was burning and we hoped the bushfires wouldn’t spread East to our spot. Weeks later the storms came and our little garden stream almost engulfed the house. Together we buried the dead kangaroo that had washed up in the flood and we learnt to live with the house spiders and the balcony snake. Just before we went back to Berlin, we heard the first news of a new virus that seemed small and far away.

                The day and night set the scene for us throughout the process. The natural physicality of it. The complex simplicity we experienced as we watched the Australian nature ebb and flow with the sun and the moon. The rapid smoky cycles that rocket a city towards ever-increasing productivity. It all became a backdrop for the songs. It became a backdrop for us to explore each other's personal experiences, together. A backdrop for all the love that happens as the earth keeps turning, all the fear, the liberation and the repetition, the hope and the disillusionment. Day and night also gave us a very exciting canvas to play with the idea of ‘self’. Shadow and light. Personalities, egos, morals and all the clouds that enshroud them.
                    
                Now it’s finished and it feels like everything has changed since those months in the forest. It's hard to explain, the process has felt like a crazy, two year long, psychedelic therapy session for 5. These records were cathartic, in the way that sometimes leaves you more confused than before, but in a good way. Most importantly they were a lot of fun to make and hopefully they can bring people some joy.</p>
